      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

      <p class="text-justify pb-10">
        The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to foster a safe, inclusive,
        respectful, and productive working environment. High-quality research
        can only be conducted when all participants feel supported and treated
        with dignity. The expectations outlined in this document apply to
        <em>everyone</em> involved in the project, without exception, including
        Principal Investigators, Postdoctoral Scientists, students,
        collaborators, etc. Nothing in this document replaces or supersedes
        applicable university policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Principles</h2>

      <p class="text-justify pb-6">We are connitted to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li>Mutual respect and professionalism</li>
        <li>Open communication and collaboration</li>
        <li>Transparent, reproducible, and open research</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="py-6">Expected Behavior</h2>

      <p class="text-justify pb-6">All participants are expected to:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Contribute constructively in meetings by listening actively, inviting
          input, and avoiding side conversations that may be distracting or
          exclusionary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Treat colleagues with respect in all interactions, communications, and
          actions.
        </li>
        <li>Learn and use colleagues’ names and correct pronunciations.</li>
        <li>
          Respect others’ working hours, availability, and response times. While
          tools such as Slack or email enable rapid communication, it should not
          be assumed that recipients are immediately available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be mindful of power dynamics. Suggestions, feedback, or requests from
          supervisors or senior collaborators may be perceived as directives by
          junior team members, even when not intended that way. Because
          supervisors and senior collaborators influence evaluations, funding,
          and authorship, their words and actions may carry more weight than
          intended. Those in positions of authority should take extra care to
          foster open discussion and to make it safe to disagree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use appropriate judgment when choosing communication channels,
          especially for sensitive or complex matters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communicate openly and clearly to avoid misunderstandings and
          inadvertent exclusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assume good faith in interactions and encourage addressing
          misunderstandings early and constructively whenever possible.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="py-6">Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

      <p class="text-justify pb-6">
        Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg text-gray-700">

        <li>Hate speech, harassment, threats, or intimidation</li>
        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
        <li>Personal attacks, bullying, or sustained disruptive behavior</li>
        <li>
          Retaliation against individuals who raise concerns in good faith
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="py-6">Reporting and Response</h2>

      <p class="text-justify pb-6">
        Reports will be handled with discretion and care. Retaliation against
        individuals who raise concerns in good faith will not be tolerated. If
        you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct,
        you are encouraged to take one of the following steps:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg text-gray-700">

          Luke, or Noah)
        </li>
        <li>Ask a trusted team member to report the concern on your behalf</li>
      </ul>
