      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

      <p class="text-justify pb-10 font-sourcesans">
        This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for professional behavior and
        shared values for all members of the CDR Forecasting Stack project.
        These expectations apply to <strong>everyone</strong> involved in the
        project, without exception, including Principal Investigators,
        Postdoctoral Scientists, students, collaborators, and etc.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify pb-10">
        This Code of Conduct applies to all project-related spaces and
        activities, including meetings, workshops, conferences, fieldwork,
        online platforms (e.g. Slack, GitHub, email), and social events
        associated with the project. Nothing in this Code of Conduct replaces or
        supersedes applicable university policies. The purpose of this Code of
        Conduct is to foster a safe, inclusive, respectful, and productive
        working environment. High-quality research can only be conducted when
        all participants feel supported and treated with dignity.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Principles</h2>

      <p class="text-justify pb-6">We are connitted to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li>Mutual respect and professionalism</li>
        <li>Open communication and collaboration</li>
        <li>Transparent, reproducible, and open research</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>

      <p class="text-justify pb-6">All participants are expected to:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Treat colleagues with respect in all interactions, communications, and
          actions.
        </li>
        <li>Learn and use colleagues’ names and correct pronunciations.</li>
        <li>
          Respect others’ working hours, availability, and response times. While
          tools such as Slack or email enable rapid communication, it should not
          be assumed that recipients are immediately available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be mindful of power dynamics. Suggestions, feedback, or requests from
          supervisors or senior collaborators may be perceived as directives by
          junior team members, even when not intended that way. Because
          supervisors and senior collaborators influence evaluations, funding,
          and authorship, their words and actions may carry more weight than
          intended. Those in positions of authority should take extra care to
          foster open discussion and to make it safe to disagree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use appropriate judgment when choosing communication channels,
          especially for sensitive or complex matters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communicate openly and clearly to avoid misunderstandings and
          inadvertent exclusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assume good faith in interactions and encourage addressing
          misunderstandings early and constructively whenever possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contribute constructively in meetings by listening actively, inviting
          input, and avoiding side conversations that may be distracting or
          exclusionary.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

      <p class="text-justify pb-6">
        Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li>Racism, sexism, ableism, or other forms of discrimination</li>
        <li>Hate speech, harassment, threats, or intimidation</li>
        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
        <li>Personal attacks, bullying, or sustained disruptive behavior</li>
        <li>
          Retaliation against individuals who raise concerns in good faith
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Reporting and Response</h2>

      <p class="text-justify pb-6">
        If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of
        Conduct, you are encouraged to take one of the following steps:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Report the concern directly to a Principal Investigator (Elizabeth,
          Luke, or Noah)
        </li>
        <li>Ask a trusted team member to report the concern on your behalf</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-justify pb-10">
        Reports will be handled with discretion and care. Retaliation against
        individuals who raise concerns in good faith will not be tolerated.
