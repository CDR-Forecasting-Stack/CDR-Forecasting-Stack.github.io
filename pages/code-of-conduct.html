        Code of Conduct
      </h1>

      <p class="text-justify pb-10">
        This statement outlines expectations of behavior and values that all
        team members must abide by, no exceptions. Principal Investigators
        (Elizabeth, Luke, Noah) will deal with any issues that may arise. This
        code of conduct is to ensure a safe and enjoyable working environment.
        High-quality research can only be conducted when you feel supported.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Unacceptable behaviors include racism, hate speech, harassment,
          threats, unwelcome sexual attention, and personal attacks.
        </li>

        <li>Be respectful in all interactions, communications, and actions.</li>

        <li>
          Take care of your choice of medium for communicating sensitive
          matters.
        </li>

        <li>
          Make a point to learn your colleague's name and correct pronunciation.
        </li>

        <li>
          Respect your colleague's working hours, limited availability, or
          response time due to family, personal, or other situations. While we
          are used to instant messages (e.g. Slack) reaching into our offices
          and homes, it is not appropriate to assume the recipient is not
          otherwise engaged.
        </li>

        <li>
          Open communication of intent and understanding are key to avoiding
          misunderstandings and inadvertent exclusion.
        </li>

        <li>
          In meetings, be considerate of all present. Make sure to listen,
          invite input, and be constructive. Avoid side conversations as they
          can be distracting.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you are the subject of, or witness to, inappropriate behavior
          please either inform a PI yourself, or ask another member whom you
          trust to do so on your behalf.
        </li>

        <li>
          We will follow the
          <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/">
            Vancouver Group recommendations (VGR)
          </a>
          on authorship
        </li>

        <li>
          We will use the
          <a href="https://credit.niso.org/">CRediT taxonomy</a> for describing
          all authorship contributions.
        </li>

        <li>
          Transparency and reproducibility of the research and publication
          process are required, not only to aid the peer review process but also
          as a guiding principle.
        </li>

        <li>
          Whenever possible, all publications should be submitted open access,
          whether via the journal as a whole, or via payment of an open access
          fee. When not possible, all coauthors should take steps to submit the
          manuscript in their respective institutions' internal server for
          publications, and also a pre-review server such as arXiv.
        </li>

        <li>
          Data used in publications should be made openly available, not just
          upon request. This can be prohibitive for some datasets but reduced
          forms of the data, as presented in the publication, are a minimum
          requirement. This is becoming the minimum standard at many journals.
        </li>

        <li>
          Copyright on codes: All codes produced within the context of CDR
          Forecasting Stack should be hosted by the CDR Forecasting Stack GitHub
          organization. Software produced in collaboration with CDR Forecasting
          Stack but not solely for CDR Forecasting Stack should be open source
          and accessible without fee or authentication barriers. It is
          reasonable to use private repositories during development. The
          particular license is up to the original authors but should ideally be
          consistent with your host institution and must be either FAIR or open
          source. We suggest the MIT license for code and the Creative Commons
